  #The supported unit strings for duration are case sensitive and must be lowercase. Exactly these strings are supported:
  #  ns, nano, nanos, nanosecond, nanoseconds
  #  us, micro, micros, microsecond, microseconds
  #  ms, milli, millis, millisecond, milliseconds
  #  s, second, seconds
  #  m, minute, minutes
  #  h, hour, hours
  #  d, day, days
  duration = 1h1m

  #The supported unit strings for period are case sensitive and must be lowercase. Exactly these strings are supported:
  #  d, day, days
  #  w, week, weeks
  #  m, mo, month, months (note that if you are using getTemporal() which may return either a java.time.Duration or a java.time.Period you will want to use mo rather than m to prevent your unit being parsed as minutes)
  #  y, year, years
  period = 1y1d

  #For single bytes, exactly these strings are supported:
  #  B, b, byte, bytes
  bytes = 1B

  #For powers of ten, exactly these strings are supported:
  #  kB, kilobyte, kilobytes
  #  MB, megabyte, megabytes
  #  GB, gigabyte, gigabytes
  #  TB, terabyte, terabytes
  #  PB, petabyte, petabytes
  #  EB, exabyte, exabytes
  #  ZB, zettabyte, zettabytes
  #  YB, yottabyte, yottabytes

  #For powers of two, exactly these strings are supported:
  #  K, k, Ki, KiB, kibibyte, kibibytes
  #  M, m, Mi, MiB, mebibyte, mebibytes
  #  G, g, Gi, GiB, gibibyte, gibibytes
  #  T, t, Ti, TiB, tebibyte, tebibytes
  #  P, p, Pi, PiB, pebibyte, pebibytes
  #  E, e, Ei, EiB, exbibyte, exbibytes
  #  Z, z, Zi, ZiB, zebibyte, zebibytes

  #Environment variables are interpreted as follows:
  #  env variables set to the empty string are kept as such (set to empty string, rather than undefined)
  #  System.getenv throws SecurityException: treated as not present
  #  encoding is handled by Java (System.getenv already returns a Unicode string)
  #  environment variables always become a string value, though if an app asks for another type automatic type conversion would kick in
